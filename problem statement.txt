The goal of this hackathon is to build a Deep learning model from scratch and compare it with that of using pre-trained models that can accurately distinguish between fake and real images using the provided images for training. The images provided belong to two classes for images that were actually clicked using cameras vs images that were artificially created using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)
Fake vs Real Image Detection Challenge Background:
========================================================



With the rise of electronic media in the form of social media primarily, there has been a lot of

misinformation spread in the form of images that are artificially created using modern augmentation tools. In order to segregate legitimate information from artificially created images, it is important to use modern technological advances to stop the spread of misinformation.

The Fake vs Real Image Detection Challenge draws inspiration from the above-mentioned misrepresentation of data and tries to solve this problem using computer vision techniques. Fake and Real images have been provided and we need to build a model that can segregate test images into Fake and Real Images. A mobile application or software integrated into the mobileâ€™s operating system can be built using this technology which can segregate fake images from real ones.

Goal:
The goal of this hackathon is to build a deep learning model from scratch and compare it with that of using pre-trained models that can accurately distinguish between fake and real images using the provided images for training. The images provided belong to two classes images that were actually clicked using cameras vs images that were artificially created using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).



Dataset and Files Information:
====================================

This dataset comprises 1709 train images segregated into separate folders for fake images and real images and 332 test images.

in the folder :-test_imageDL,train_imageDL

You have also been provided with a train_image.csv file which contains the labels for each file name and a test_image.csv file has been provided for the names of all test images in the test folder.

A sample_submission_DL.csv file has been provided to help you submit your predictions against the file names in the test folder.

Evaluation Metric

Accuracy - Total number of correct predictions/ Total number of data samples

Submission Format

You need to submit the CSV format file with 2 columns in order -

file_id and label using the test dataset.

Hint: If you face any issue with regard to computation, reduce the target size of your images to 32x32 in order to train faster and try more iterations intraday.
